REST implementation of a couple of GET functions

Code coverage is sitting at 81.1%

Important:
- Java 8 features used: Stream (just marginally), and Optionals

The project has exactly what it needs to function. As such, it should be enough to evaluate the quality of the implementation
Here's what could be improved, though:
- Detailed Javadocs
- Moving the .gitignore file to the project's root, and ensuring it's properly configured
- Endpoint implementation of the remaining CRUD Operations on both City and Country entities
- Proper integration testing in a different build phase
- Mock providers for data reusability among tests

Thank you!,
Marcel
