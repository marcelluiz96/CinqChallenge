REST implementation of a couple of GET functions

Code coverage is sitting at 81.1%
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelluiz96/CinqChallenge/master/images/testcoverage.png)

Important:
- Java 8 features used: Stream (just marginally), and Optionals.
- Testing was made using JUnit. Integration testing wasn't properly made

The project has exactly what it needs to function. As such, it should be enough to evaluate the quality of the implementation
Here's what could be improved:
- A .gitignore file
- Endpoint implementation of the remaining CRUD Operations on both City and Country entities
- Proper integration testing
- Mock providers for reusability among tests
- POM.XML organization


Don't use this code even if you'd go as far as cheating.

Thank you!,
Marcel
