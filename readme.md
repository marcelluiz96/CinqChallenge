REST implementation of a couple of GET functions

Code coverage is sitting at 81.1%

Important:
- Java 8 features used: Stream (just marginally), and Optionals

The project has exactly what it needs to function, and was made in a bit of a hurry.

From a quick look, here's what could be improved:
- Defining more test cases (code coverage was OK, but testing all possible scenarios was not)
- Detailed Javadocs
- Moving the .gitignore file to the project's root, and ensuring it's properly configured
- Endpoint implementation of the remaining CRUD Operations on both City and Country entities
- Proper integration testing in a different build phase
- Mock providers for data reusability among tests


Thank you!,
